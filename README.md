# BSOD Sweeper
This is a fork of [ReactOS](https://github.com/reactos/reactos)'s version of WineMine.

And it has a *little* twist!

## What twist, you may ask?
Well, there are several twists.
* You cannot close the window or the system will BSOD.
* You cannot minimize the window.
* The code is a big hack made in 20 minutes.
* The window will always stay on top.
* If you hit a mine, your system will BSOD.
* It will only let you close this if you beat it.
